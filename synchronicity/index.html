<!---Class of '83            -->
<!---************************-->

<p>Not long after Michael Jackson's <em>Thriller</em> began its ascent to selling an all-time record 70 million albums following its release in late 1982, the English power trio The Police <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_200_number-one_albums_of_1983" target ="_blank">twice interrupted Jackson's reign</a> at the top of the charts with their genre-bending <em>Synchronicity</em>. 
  
 

<p>Bolstered by a swarm of hits including <em>Every Breath You Take</em>, <em>Synchronicity II</em>, <em>King of Pain</em>, and <em>Wrapped Around Your Finger</em>, The Police held their own in direct competition with Jackson hits such as <em>Billie Jean</em>, <em>Beat It</em>, and <em>Human Nature</em>. 1983 opened under the reign of <em>Business as Usual</em> by Men at Work, and ex-Commodore Lionel Richie saw success in December, but <em>Thriller</em> and <em>Synchronicity</em> dominated the charts for most of the year.

<!---band dysfunction            -->
<!---************************-->

<p>Behind the scenes, The Police were dysfunctional. something about recording separately. that record would be their last

[substantiate this with my reading] Sting cast out on his own, etc. Though he's promoting his work for 4 decades.

put in some real substantive detail about inner conflicts!

<!---longevity            -->
<!---************************-->
<p>Forty years later, The Police are not forgotten. Sting's proclivity towards philosophy and literary references helped anchor the band's place in history. <em>Wrapped Around Your Finger</em> referenced timeless works of Faust and Greek mythology, while <em>Synchronicity II</em> describes suburban commuters "packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes" much as they are today.

<p>
  <p>But in the 40 years following <em>Synchronicity</em>, The Police never recorded a followup record. Sting and Stewart Copeland are now in their 70s, Andy Summers recently turned 80, and the band's aging fan base is gradually getting plucked away by the Grim Reaper. The three artists remain active in their solo work. But <em>Synchronicity</em> has largely been sustained by deeply engaged fans.
    
    <p>Some of the most devoted Police followers have published a plethora of covers over the years. Data acquired from <a href="https://secondhandsongs.com/release/413">Second Hand Songs</a>, a database of officially published cover tunes, shows Synchronicity in the shadow of the Michael Jackson's Thriller, but well beyond its other popular peers from the class of 1983.

<p>Every Breath You Take has been a runaway favorite cover. But tribute bands have breathed new life into some of the more experimental tracks. Tea in the Sahara, for instance, charted well <a href="http://tsort.info/music/v0ku62.htm">only in Poland</a> at the time of its release, but Second Hand Songs tracks 21 published covers in the four decades since.

  <h3>The Police Will Turn Your Face to Alabaster</h3>
<p>In February of this year, the U.S. Library of Congress helped <a target="_blank" href="https://digital.abcaudio.com/news/polices-synchronicity-turns-40">cement <em>Synchronicity's</em> place in history</a> by placing it in the National Recording Registry for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant." 

<p>And then in June, the instrumental trio <em>Hazelrigg Brothers</em> published a cover of <em>Synchronicity</em> in its entirety. Notably this recording includes a take of <em>Miss Gradenko</em>, a Stewart-Copeland-penned track that hadn't yet been covered in the Second Hand Songs database.
