    <h1>Who's Still Riding the CTA?</h1>
  

<p>Ridership on Chicago's CTA trains dropped sharply following the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic and a subsequent <a href="https://www.illinois.gov/news/press-release.21288.html#:~:text=The%20order%20takes%20effect%205,of%20more%20than%2010%20people">stay-at-home order issued by the State of Illinois in March 2020</a>. As reported by the CTA, Chicago retained less than a third of its previous year ridership in 2020, a trend <a href="https://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/6/Ridership_Report_-_2020_Annual_Report.pdf">comparable to other cities including New York, Boston and Philadelphia.</a>

<p>Following the introduction of vaccines in 2021 and <a href="https://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/6/2022_Annual_Report_-_FINAL.pdf">lifting of a statewide mask mandate</a>, ridership recovered to nearly half its pre-pandemic levels by 2022. But that recovery has been uneven.

<p>Data acquired from the CTA show that Suburban Oak Park blue line and some downtown loop stations saw little more than a third of pre-pandemic ridership by 2022. In contrast, the five stations sustaining the most ridership are all on the Pink Line-- a train which serves predominantly black and Hispanic working-class neighborhoods.

<p>A report by the Urban Institute in late 2021 tracked similar patterns in San Francisco, New York, and DC, noting that stations in communities with more non-white residents, lower median incomes, and more working-class jobs <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/transit-ridership-dropped-heavy-rail-stations-during-covid-19-pandemic-ridership-change-depended-neighborhood-characteristics">retained more riders</a>. Chicago's Pink Line cuts through Lower West Side, South Lawndale, and North Lawndale, which <a href="https://www.wbez.org/stories/where-we-are-mapping-chicagos-racial-divisions/5912e6be-6a04-4df4-bdcc-ce48c8014706">match these characteristics</a>.

<p>Notably, Oak Park, a relatively affluent west suburb with a median income of $xx,xxx. Cicero, a less affluent west suburb with a median income of $xx,xxx, saw x% ridership retention.
