    <h1>The Staying Power of Synchronicity</h1>
<!---<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Sum is Greater Than Its Summers, Sumner, and Copeland</h3>--->  

<p>No record has ever topped the 70 million worldwide sales of Michael Jackson's album <em>Thriller</em>, but the English band The Police <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_200_number-one_albums_of_1983" target ="_blank">twice interrupted Jackson's reign</a> as the top-seller in 1983 with their genre-bending album <em>Synchronicity</em>. 
  
  June 17 = 40 year anniversary of release


<p>Bolstered by a swarm of hits including <em>Every Breath You Take</em>, <em>King of Pain</em>, and <em>Wrapped Around Your Finger</em>, The Police held their own in direct competition with Jackson hits such as <em>Billie Jean</em>, <em>Beat It</em>, and <em>Human Nature</em>. The year opened under the reign of <em>Business as Usual</em> by Men at Work, and ex-Commodore Lionel Richie saw some success in December, but <em>Thriller</em> and <em>Synchronicity</em> dominated the charts for most of the year.

<p>Behind the scenes, The Police were dysfunctional. something about recording separately. that record would be their last

[substantiate this with my reading] Sting cast out on his own, etc. Though he's promoting his work for 4 decades.

put in some real substantive detail about inner conflicts!

<p>But the Police haven't recorded a record since 1983, and Sting is getting old. Will they too fade as their aging fan base meets the grim reaper?

Alexander von Humboldt was <a href="https://humboldtparkmoon.com/creation-and-destruction-in-the-americas-of-alexander-von-humboldt/">one of the most famous men in the world in 1869</a>. Thomas Paine's Common Sense was <a href="https://www.litcharts.com/lit/amusing-ourselves-to-death/chapter-3-typographic-america">compared with the Super Bowl</a> in its popularity in 1776. 

40 years later...
Data acquired from <a href="https://secondhandsongs.com/release/413">Second Hand Songs</a>, a database of officially published cover tunes, shows the Police have some help in propagating their legacy.

Though once again in the shadow of Thriller, covers of Synchronicity dwarf covers of Lionel Richie and Men at Work, its popular peers from '83. Deep engagement ensures will live on.

<p>something about folk songs, generations of covers<br>

  <p>Dominated by Every Breath You Take, other hits. But Tea in the Sahara, charted in Poland, surprising staying power (why?).
